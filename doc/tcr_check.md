## tcr check

Check TCR configuration and parameters and exit

### Synopsis


When used in "check" mode, TCR performs a series of verifications on provided parameters,
configuration and local environment, then exits.

Its purpose is to verify that TCR is ready to run. It does not trigger any TCR cycle execution.

The main checkpoints are organized in sections as follows:

- Configuration directory
- Base directory
- Work Directory
- Language settings
- Toolchain settings
- VCS environment
- Auto-push settings
- Mob timer settings (for driver role)
- Polling period settings (for navigator role)

The return code of TCR "check" is one of the following:

| RC  | Meaning                                                                    |
|-----|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0   | All checks passed without any warning or error                             |
| 1   | One or more warnings were raised. This should not prevent TCR from running |
| 2   | One or more errors were raised. TCR will not be able to run properly       |
