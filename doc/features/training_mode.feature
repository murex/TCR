Feature: Using TCR for training

  Scenario: Learning test-driven development
    Given I am learning TDD
    When I use TCR
    Then I receive immediate feedback on my steps
    And I learn to work incrementally

  Scenario: Coaching sessions
    Given I am coaching developers
    When I introduce TCR
    Then it helps demonstrate discipline and focus
    And it sparks discussions about testing and design
