# TCR — Human-readable features as documentation

This folder contains **human-readable feature specifications** describing
how TCR works in training and real-life usage.

These files implement the feature request to use
human-readable tests as documentation for the main scenarios of TCR.

The goals are to:
- Explain TCR behavior to new users
- Serve as onboarding and coaching material
- Act as living documentation
- Potentially evolve into executable tests

At this stage, these files are **documentation-first** and not executed.

They are written in a Gherkin-like format to remain readable and structured.
