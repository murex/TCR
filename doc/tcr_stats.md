## tcr stats

Print TCR stats

### Synopsis


TCR stats subcommand prints out TCR usage stats based on commit history.

The commit history is retrieved for the repository containing
TCR base directory (cf. -b option). The branch is the current working
branch set for this repository.

The following stats are reported:

- First commit date and time
- Last commit date and time
- Number of commits
- Number of passing commits (absolute value and percentage) (*)
- Number of failing commits, (absolute value and percentage) (*)
- Time span between the first and last commit
- Time in green: total time where all tests passed (absolute value and percentage) (*)
- Time in red: total time where one or more tests failed (absolute value and percentage) (*)
- Time between commits (minimum, average and maximum values)
- Changes per commit (src): number of lines of source code changed per commit (minimum, average and maximum values)
- Changes per commit (test): number of lines of test code changed per commit (minimum, average and maximum values)
- Passing tests count evolution (values for first and last commit)
- Failing tests count evolution (values for first and last commit) (*)
- Skipped tests count evolution (values for first and last commit)
- Test execution duration cumulated for all tests (values for first and last commit)

> (*) These metrics are relevant only if TCR commit history was created while running TCR with "commit-failures" option.
> Without this option there is no record of test failures in TCR commit history, thus:
> - "Number of passing commits" and "time in green" will always be at 100%
> - "Number of failing commits" and "time in red" will always be at 0%
> - "Failing tests" will always be at 0

This subcommand does not start TCR engine.
